      DLAP Files <br> Sparse Linear Algebra Package <br> File Format
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>DLAP</b> is a data directory which
      contains examples of "DLAP" files.  These are files associated
      with the Sparse Linear Algebra Package of Anne Greenbaum
      and Mark Seager.  This package includes a file format that may
      be used to store matrices externally.

      DLAP File Characteristics:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          ASCII;
        </li>
        <li>
          Store the nonzero elements of a matrix <b>A</b>;
        </li>
        <li>
          Use a simple scheme in which every nonzero element is stored
          as a row index, column index and value;
        </li>
        <li>
          includes a space=saving option for symmetric matrices;
        </li>
        <li>
          may include one right hand side vector <b>b</b>;
        </li>
        <li>
          may include one solution vector <b>x</b>;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      DLAP files begin with a single header line containing five integers.
      These integers are written in a FORTRAN FORMAT of '(5I10)', that is,
      five integers, each written into a field of width 10 characters,
      and right justified.  The format is
      <pre>
        N NELT ISYM IRHS ISOLN
      </pre>
      The interpretation of these values is as follows:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>N</b>, the order of the matrix;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>NELT</b>, the number of nonzero values stored;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>ISYM</b>, 1 if the matrix is symmetric, and only the
          lower triangular part is explicitly stored;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>IRHS</b>, 1 if a right hand side vector is included;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>ISOLN</b>, 1 if a solution vector is included;
        </li>
      </ol>
      Note that, presumably, one would only include a solution vector
      if one is also including a right hand side.  In fact, the DLAP software,
      as written, will not properly handle a DLAP file that contains
      a solution vector but not a right hand side.
    </p>

    <p>
      Immediately following the header line comes a series of NELT
      records, each containing the row, column and value of a nonzero
      entry of the matrix.  Each line is written in a FORTRAN FORMAT
      of '(1X,I5,1X,I5,1X,E16.7)', that is, a space, a right-justified
      integer in a field of width 5, a space, another right-justified
      integer in a field of width 5, a space, and a real number in
      a field of width 16, with 7 digits after the decimal place and
      written in an exponential format.  For K = 1 to NELT, the format is
      <pre>
        IA(K) JA(K) A(K)
      </pre>
      The interpretation of these values is as follows:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>IA(K)</b>, the row index of the K-th element;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>JA(K)</b>, the column index of the K-th element;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>A(K)</b>, the value of the K-th element;
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      If IRHS = 1, then there follow N records containing a right
      hand side vector.  Each line is written in a FORTRAN FORMAT
      of '(1X,E16.7)', that is, a space, and a real number in
      a field of width 16, with 7 digits after the decimal place and
      written in an exponential format.  For I = 1 to N, the format is
      <pre>
        RHS(I)
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      If ISOLN = 1, then there follow N records containing a solution
      vector.  Each line is written in a FORTRAN FORMAT
      of '(1X,E16.7)', that is, a space, and a real number in
      a field of width 16, with 7 digits after the decimal place and
      written in an exponential format.  For I = 1 to N, the format is
      <pre>
        SOLN(I)
      </pre>
