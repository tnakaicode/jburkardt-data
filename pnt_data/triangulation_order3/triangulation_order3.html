      TRIANGULATION_ORDER3 <br> Files Defining an Order 3 Triangulation
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TRIANGULATION_ORDER3</b>
      is a data directory which
      contains examples of triangulation data of order 3.
    </p>

    <p>
      Defining a triangulation requires two files:
      <ul>
        <li>
          the <i>node file</i> lists the coordinates of
          a set of points.  NODE_XY(I,J) is the I-th coordinate of the J-th node.
        </li>
        <li>
          the <i>element file</i> lists triples of node indices, forming
          the elements.  ELEMENT_NODE(I,J) is the index of the I-th node that
          forms the J-th element.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Other files that may be supplied include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          the <i>element neighbor file</i>.  ELEMENT_NEIGHBOR(I,J)
          lists the index of the element that is a neighbor along the
          element edge that is opposite to node ELEMENT_NODE(I,J),
          or -1 if no such neighbor exists.
        </li>
        <li>
          the <i>boundarynode file</i> lists a 0 for each interior node,
          and a 1 for each node on the boundary of the region.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      This is the simplest form of a triangulation.  It is sometimes
      called a <i>linear triangulation</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the moment, no facility is provided for allowing the specification
      of constrained edges, or the existence of holes in the region, both
      of which are of some interest.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Example of a node file:
    </h3>

    <p>
      A node file can come from anywhere.  In most cases, you generate
      this data by observation or the characteristics of a particular
      problem or set of data you are working on.  In some cases, you start
      only with a region, and must fill the region with random points, or
      with well separated points.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a simple example, suppose we had the following set of points:
      <pre>
        19 20 21

        16 17 18

        11 12 13 14 15

         6  7  8  9 10

         1  2  3  4  5
      </pre>
      then the node file might look like this:
      <pre>
        0.0  0.0
        1.0  0.0
        2.0  0.0
        3.0  0.0
        4.0  0.0
        0.0  1.0
        1.0  1.0
        2.0  1.0
        3.0  1.0
        4.0  1.0
        0.0  2.0
        1.0  2.0
        2.0  2.0
        3.0  2.0
        4.0  2.0
        0.0  3.0
        1.0  3.0
        2.0  3.0
        0.0  4.0
        1.0  4.0
        2.0  4.0
      </pre>
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Example of an element file:
    </h3>

    <p>
      An element file describes how triangular elements are formed from the nodes.
      In an order 3 triangulation, each element is described by just 3 nodes.
      (An order 6 triangulation includes an extra node along the middle of each side).
      If you have nodes, but no triangulation of them, then there are programs
      available which can form a Delaunay triangulation of the nodes.
    </p>

    <p>
      A possible order 3 triangulation of these nodes is:
      <pre>
        19-20-21
         |\ |\ |
         | \| \|
        16-17-18
         |\ |\ |
         | \| \|
        11-12-13-14-15
         |\ |\ |\ |\ |
         | \| \| \| \|
         6--7--8--9-10
         |\ |\ |\ |\ |
         | \| \| \| \|
         1--2--3--4--5
      </pre>
      in which case the element file would look like this:
      <pre>
         1  2  6
         7  6  2
         2  3  7
         8  7  3
         3  4  8
         9  8  4
         4  5  9
        10  9  5
         6  7 11
        12 11  7
         7  8 12
        13 12  8
         8  9 13
        14 13  9
         9 10 14
        15 14 10
        11 12 16
        17 16 12
        12 13 17
        18 17 13
        16 17 19
        20 19 17
        17 18 20
        21 20 18
      </pre>
      The elements could be listed in any order.  The three nodes
      of the element could be listed in any <i>counterclockwise</i>
      order.
    </p>

     <h3 align = "center">
      Example of an element neighbor file:
    </h3>

    <p>
      The element neighbor file lists the elements which are neighbors to
      a given element.  The convention is that ELEMENT_NEIGHBOR(I,J) is the
      index of the element that is adjacent to the triangle on the side 
      opposite ELEMENT_NODE(I,J).  If there is no neighbor on that side
      then we set the entry to -1.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the example problem, the neighbor file would look like:
      <pre>
 2  -1  -1   
 1   3   9   
 4   2  -1      
 3   5  11   
 6   4  -1   
 5   7  13   
 8   6  -1   
 7  -1  15   
10  -1   2  
 9  11  17   
12  10   4  
11  13  19  
14  12   6  
13  15  -1  
16  14   8  
15  -1  -1  
18  -1  10  
17  19  21  
20  18  12  
19  -1  23  
22  -1  18  
21  23  -1  
24  22  20  
23  -1  -1  
      </pre>
    </p>

     <h3 align = "center">
      Example of an boundarynode file:
    </h3>

    <p>
      The boundary node file could list a 0 for each interior node, a 1 for each
      boundary node.  This approach is convenient if inefficient, since it allows
      us to set aside space for the array immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the example problem, the boundarynode file would look like:
      <pre>
        1
        1
        1
        1
        1
        1
        0
        0
        0
        1
        1
        0
        1
        1
        1
        1
        0
        1
        1
        1
        1
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      An alternative format would simply list the indices of the boundary nodes:
      <pre>
         1
         2
         3
         4
         5
         6
        10
        11
        13
        14
        15
        16
        18
        19
        20
        21
      </pre>
      and while this file lists the nodes in order, this is not essential.
    </p>

     <h3 align = "center">
      Example of an boundary edge file:
    </h3>

    <p>
      We might wish to describe the boundary by listing the edges that form it.
      We would describe an edge as a pair of nodes.  We will want to list
      these pairs in such a way that the boundary is traversed in counterclockwise
      order.  Interior holes can also be handled this way, although then the
      curve is essentially traversed in clockwise order.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the example problem, a boundary edge file might look like:
      <pre>
         1  2
         2  3
         3  4
         4  5
         5 10
        10 15
        15 14
        14 13
        13 18
        18 21
        21 20
        20 19
        19 16
        16 11
        11  6
         6  1
      </pre>
      Although we have listed the edges in a way that traverses the entire
      boundary consecutively, that is not of the highest importance.
