      TRIANGULATION_ORDER6 <br> Pairs of Files Defining an Order 6 Triangulation
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TRIANGULATION_ORDER6</b>
      is a data directory which
      defines the format of files for storing triangulation data of order 6.
    </p>

    <p>
      Defining a triangulation requires two files:
      <ul>
        <li>
          the <i>node file</i> lists the coordinates of
          a set of points.
        </li>
        <li>
          the <i>element file</i> lists sets of six node indices, which
          are the vertices and side nodes.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The six node triangulation, sometimes called a <i>quadratic
      triangulation</i>, includes the extra three nodes to allow for a
      higher degree of approximation when a finite element method is used.
      When listing the six nodes for a given triangle, the first
      three items are the vertices, in counterclockwise order.  The
      fourth item is the side node between nodes 1 and 2, the fifth
      the side node between nodes 2 and 3, and the sixth the side node
      between nodes 3 and 1.
    </p>

    <p>
      The point sets are distinguished by the values of the following
      parameters:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>M</b>, the spatial dimension;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>N</b>, the number of points;
        </li>
      </ul>
      The values of M and N are specified in the dataset file names.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the moment, no facility is provided for allowing the specification
      of constrained edges, or the existence of holes in the region, both
      of which are of some interest.
    </p>

      Example of a node file:
    </h3>

    <p>
      A node file can come from anywhere.  In most cases, you generate
      this data by observation or the characteristics of a particular
      problem or set of data you are working on.  In some cases, you start
      only with a region, and must fill the region with random points, or
      with well separated points.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a simple example, suppose we had the following set of points:
      <pre>
        11 12 13 14 15

         6  7  8  9 10

         1  2  3  4  5
      </pre>
      then the node file might look like this:
      <pre>
        #  Node file for simple example.
        #
        0.0  0.0
        1.0  0.0
        2.0  0.0
        3.0  0.0
        4.0  0.0
        0.0  1.0
        1.0  1.0
        2.0  1.0
        3.0  1.0
        4.0  1.0
        0.0  2.0
        1.0  2.0
        2.0  2.0
        3.0  2.0
        4.0  2.0
      </pre>
    </p>

      Example of a triangle file:
    </h3>

    <p>
      A triangulation file describes how triangles are formed from the nodes.
      In an order 3 triangulation, each triangle is described by just 3 nodes.
      (An order 6 triangulation includes an extra node along the middle of each side).
      If you have nodes, but no triangulation of them, then there are programs
      available which can form a Delaunay triangulation of the nodes.
    </p>

    <p>
      This triangulation will be order 3, so it is then necessary to convert the
      triangulation to order 6 by adding the midside nodes of each triangle.
    </p>

    <p>
      An order 6 triangulation of these nodes is:
      <pre>
        11-12-13-14-15
         |\    |\    |
         | \   | \   |
         6  7  8  9 10
         |   \ |   \ |
         |    \|    \|
         1--2--3--4--5
      </pre>
      in which case the triangle file would look like this:
      <pre>
        #  Triangle file for simple example.
        #
         1  3 11  2  7  6
        13 11  3 12  7  8
         3  5 13  4  9  8
        15 13  5 14  9 10
      </pre>
      The triangles could be listed in any order.
