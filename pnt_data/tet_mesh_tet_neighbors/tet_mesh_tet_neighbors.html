      TET_MESH_TET_NEIGHBORS <br> Adjacency information in a tetrahedral mesh
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TET_MESH_TET_NEIGHBORS</b> is a data directory which
      contains examples of a format for
      recording tetrahedral adjacency in a tetrahedral mesh of 3D points.
    </p>

    <p>
      The tetrahedral mesh is presumed to be constructed in such a way
      that the only possible adjacency occurs if two tetrahedrons share
      a face.  A tetrahedron has four faces, and hence may have anywhere
      from 0 to 4 neighbors.  The faces and neighbors are conveniently
      associated with the index of the single tetrahedron vertex that is
      <i>not</i> part of the shared face.  Thus neighbor 1 is presumed to
      share the face constructed from local nodes 2, 3 and 4.  If there
      is no neighbor sharing a particular face, the index of that neighbor
      is recorded as -1.
    </p>

    <p>
      This adjacency information is derived from the more fundamental
      data structures that define the tetrahedral mesh.  For more information,
      see <a href = "../../data/tet_mesh_order4/tet_mesh_order4.html">
      order 4 tet mesh format</a> or
      <a href = "../../data/tet_mesh_order10/tet_mesh_order10.html">
      order 10 tet mesh format</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The neighbor information may be stored as an array with
      4 rows and TETRA_NUM columns, or it may be written to a file
      of TETRA_NUM lines, each containing the indices of the four
      neighbors of the corresponding tetrahedron.

    <p>
      For a tetrahedral mesh with 6 tetrahedrons, here is what
      a file might look like that contained the adjacency information:
      <pre>
       -1  2 -1  3
       -1  1 -1  5
       -1  1  4 -1
       -1  6  3 -1
       -1  2  6 -1
       -1  4  5 -1
      </pre>
