    <p>
      <b>POLYGONAL_SURFACE</b>
      is a data directory which
      contains examples of files defining a polygonal surface.
    </p>

    <p>
      A polygonal surface
      can be thought of as a surface composed of polygonal faces.
      The polygons must all be of the same type (triangles, quadrilaterals
      or whatever).
    </p>

    <p>
      If the polygons are of higher order than triangles,
      the user must take care that the vertices of each polygon all
      lie in a plane.  Otherwise, no planar polygon will pass through
      the vertices.  If the nonplanarity is significant, then the
      display will not look right at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      The information defining the polygonal surface can be stored in
      two simple files:
      <ul>
        <li>
          the <i>node file</i> lists a set of <b>(x,y,z)</b> values,
          which are vertices of the polygons.
        </li>
        <li>
          the <i>element file</i> lists, for each polygonal face,
          the indices of the nodes that form its vertices.  These nodes
          are generally listed in a "counterclockwise" order, that is,
          they would be seen as being counterclockwise to an observer
          from the "outside" or "top" of the surface.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
