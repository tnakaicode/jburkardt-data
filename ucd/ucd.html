      UCD Files

    <p>
      <b>UCD</b> is a data directory which
      contains examples of Unstructured Cell Data (UCD),
      a format supported by AVS.
    </p>

    <p>
      AVS uses the convention that a <b>UCD</b> file name ends with the
      extension <b>.inp</b>, but for my own system, I prefer to use the
      extension <b>.ucd</b>.

      UCD format:
    </h3>

    <p>
      For the ASCII UCD format, the file cannot contain any blank lines.
    </p>

    <p>
      Comments begin with the "#", and are only allowed at the beginning of
      the file.
    </p>

    <p>
      Section 1 of the file is a single line listing five values:
      the number of nodes, the number of cells, the number of data items per
      node, the number of data items per cell, and the model number
      (which is always 0).
    </p>

    <p>
      Section 2 of the file lists the node coordinates.  Each line lists
      the node id or label, followed by the (X,Y,Z) coordinates of that node.
    </p>

    <p>
      Section 3 of the file lists, for each cell, the cell id or label,
      the cell material (make it 0), the cell type, and the node id's or
      labels of the nodes that are associated with the cell.  Cell types
      include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>pt</b>, a point;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>line</b>, a line;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>tri</b>, a triangle;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>quad</b>, a quadrilateral;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>tet</b>, a tetrahedron;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>pyr</b>, a pyramid;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>prism</b>, a prism;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>hex</b>, a hexahedron (a 6-sided solid).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Section 4 of the file describes the node data, if there is any.
      First, it lists the number of components the node data is divided into,
      and then, for each component, the number of values associated with
      that component.  For instance, suppose the number of node data
      items was given in section 1 as 6, and that these items were
      divided into 3 components, a scalar, a vector of three values,
      and a vector of 2 values.  Then this line would read
      "3,1,3,2".
    </p>

    <p>
      Section 5 of the file gives, for each node data component,
      a component label and component units, separated by a comma.
    </p>

    <p>
      Section 6 of the file lists, for each node, the node label or id,
      followed by the node data values for that node.
    </p>

    <p>
      Section 7 of the file describes the cell data, if there is any.
      First, it lists the number of components the cell data is divided into,
      and then, for each component, the number of values associated with
      that component.
    </p>

    <p>
      Section 8 of the file gives, for each cell data component,
      a component label and component units, separated by a comma.
    </p>

    <p>
      Section 9 of the file lists, for each cell, the cell label or id,
      followed by the cell data values for that cell.
