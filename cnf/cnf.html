      CNF Files

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CNF</b> is a data directory which
      contains examples of files stored using the DIMACS CNF file format.
      This format is used to define a Boolean expression,
      written in conjunctive normal form, that may be used as an example
      of the satisfiability problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      The satisfiability problem considers the case in which N boolean
      variables are used to form a Boolean expression involving negation (<b>NOT</b>),
      conjunction (<b>AND</b>) and disjunction (<b>OR</b>).  The problem is
      to determine whether there is any assignment of values to the Boolean
      variables which makes the formula true.  It's something like trying to
      flip a bunch of switches to find the setting that makes a light bulb turn on.
    </p>

    <p>
      For simplicity, it is common to require that the boolean expression be
      written in conjunction normal form or "CNF".  A formula in conjunctive
      normal form consists:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <i>clauses</i> joined by <b>AND</b>;
        </li>
        <li>
          each clause, in turn, consists of <i>literals</i> joined
          by <b>OR</b>;
        </li>
        <li>
          each literal is either the name of a variable <i>(a positive literal</i>, or the
          name of a variable preceded by <b>NOT</b> <i>(a negative literal</i>.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      An example of a boolean expression in 3 variables and 2 clauses:
      <pre><b>
        ( x(1) OR ( NOT x(3) ) )
        AND
        ( x(2) OR x(3) OR ( NOT x(1) ) ).
      </b></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The CNF file format is an ASCII file format.
      <ol>
        <li>
          The file may begin with comment lines.  The first character of each
          comment line must be a lower case letter "c".  Comment lines typically
          occur in one section at the beginning of the file, but are allowed to
          appear throughout the file.
        </li>
        <li>
          The comment lines are followed by the "problem" line.  This begins
          with a lower case "p" followed by a space, followed by the
          problem type, which for CNF files is "cnf", followed by the number
          of variables followed by the number of clauses.
        </li>
        <li>
          The remainder of the file contains lines defining the clauses, one by one.
        </li>
        <li>
          A clause is defined by listing the index of each positive literal, and the
          negative index of each negative literal.  Indices are 1-based,
          and for obvious reasons the index 0 is not allowed.
        </li>
        <li>
          The definition of a clause may extend beyond a single line of text.
        </li>
        <li>
          The definition of a clause is terminated by a final value of "0".
        </li>
        <li>
          The file terminates after the last clause is defined.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      Some odd facts include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          The definition of the next clause normally begins on a new line,
          but may follow, on the same line, the "0" that marks the end of the
          previous clause.
        </li>
        <li>
          In some examples of CNF files, the definition of the last clause
          is not terminated by a final '0';
        </li>
        <i>
          In some examples of CNF files, the rule that the variables are numbered
          from 1 to N is not followed.  The file might declare that there are 10
          variables, for instance, but allow them to be numbered 2 through 11.

      Here is the CNF file that corresponds to the simple formula discussed above:
