      DOLFIN-CONVERT</a>,
      a Python program which
      can convert a mesh file from Gmsh, MEDIT, METIS or SCOTCH format to an
      XML format suitable for use by DOLFIN or FENICS,

      <a href = "../../c_src/fem_to_xml/fem_to_xml.html">
      FEM_TO_XML</a>,
      a C program which
      reads FEM files defining a 1D, 2D or 3D mesh, namely
      a file of node coordinates and a file of elements defined by
      node indices, and creates a corresponding XML file for input
      to DOLFIN or FENICS.

      a Python program which
      reads an XML file created by FENICS or DOLFIN, describing a mesh
      in 1D, 2D, or 3D, and extracts two sets of information, namely,
      the coordinates of nodes, and the indices of nodes that form each element,
      which constitute an FEM model of the mesh.
