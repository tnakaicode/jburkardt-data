    <p>
      <b>FD2D</b>
      is a data directory which
      contains examples of 2D FD files, which define a finite difference model.
    </p>

    <p>
      The FD format is a simple dataset of two files that
      can be used to describe a finite difference model.
    </p>

    <p>
      The finite difference model is assumed to include just two kinds of information:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Node coordinates in 2D;
        </li>
        <li>
          Node values (scalars, vectors, or any set of data);
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      FD File Characteristics:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          ASCII
        </li>
        <li>
          Each line is one "record"
        </li>
        <li>
          Each record is either a comment record or a data record;
        </li>
        <li>
          Comment records begin with the "#" character;
        </li>
        <li>
          A data record records node coordinates for one node, or
          the set of node data for one node;
        </li>
        <li>
          For a given file, each data record contains the same number
          of items, separated by blanks.
        </li>
      </ul>
