    <p>
      <b>METIS_GRAPH</b> is a data directory which
      contains examples of "graph" files used by the METIS program.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>METIS</b> can read a graph file, and partition the nodes
      in a balanced way so that each partition has about the same
      number of nodes, and the number of cut edges is minimized.
      This process is designed with the idea that the graph represents
      a computation that is to be divided up among various processors,
      with the stipulation that the amount of interprocessor communication
      must be limited.

      METIS GRAPH File Characteristics:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          ASCII
        </li>
        <li>
          a graph of <b>N</b> nodes is stored in a file of <b>N+1</b> lines;
        </li>
        <li>
          the first line lists the number of nodes and the number of edges;
        </li>
        <li>
          If the first line contains more than two values, the extra values
          indicate the weights;
        </li>
        <li>
          each subsequent line lists the "neighbors" of a node;
        </li>
        <li>
          comment lines begin with a "%" sign;
        </li>
      </ul>
