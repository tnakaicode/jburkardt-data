      STLB Files <br> Stereolithography (binary)
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>STLB</b> is a data directory which
      contains examples of STLB, or "binary STL" files.  "STL" stands for
      "stereolithography", and indicates that the primary purpose of this
      file format is to describe the shape of a 3D stationary object.
      Stereolithography is a means of creating physical 3D models of
      such objects, using resin or carefully cut and joined pieces of paper.
    </p>

    <p>
      A binary STL file usually has a filename extension of ".stl".
    </p>

    <p>
      A binary STL file contains a description of the surface of a solid that has been
      decomposed into triangles.  The vertices of the triangles should
      be listed in counterclockwise order, as viewed from outside the surface.
      A normal vector for the triangle may also be listed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The file begins with a <b>solid</b> record, (which can include a name
      for the object), and ends with an <b>endsolid</b> record.  Each
      triangle begins with a <b>facet</b> record and ends with an
      <b>endfacet</b> record.  The normal vector, if given, is included as
      part of the <b>facet</b> record, and is identified by the <b>normal</b>
      keyword.  The normal vector should have unit length.  The three vertices
      of the triangle are delimited by <b>outer loop</b> and </b>endloop</b>
      records.  Each vertex is described on a <b>vertex</b> record that
      lists its (X,Y,Z) coordinates.
    </p>

    <p>
      A binary STL file has the following structure:
      <ul>
        <li>
          An 80 byte ASCII header that can be used as a title.
        </li>
        <li>
          A 4 byte unsigned long integer, the number of facets.
        </li>
        <li>
          For each facet, a facet record of 50 bytes.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The facet record has the form:
      <ul>
        <li>
          The normal vector, 3 floating values of 4 bytes each;
        </li>
        <li>
          Vertex 1 XYZ coordinates, 3 floating values of 4 bytes each;
        </li>
        <li>
          Vertex 2 XYZ coordinates, 3 floating values of 4 bytes each;
        </li>
        <li>
          Vertex 3 XYZ coordinates, 3 floating values of 4 bytes each;
        </li>
        <li>
          An unsigned integer, of 2 bytes, that should be zero;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
