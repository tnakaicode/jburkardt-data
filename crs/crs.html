    <p>
      <b>crs</b>,
      a data directory which
      contains examples of the Compressed Row Storage (CRS) 
      sparse matrix file format.
    </p>

    <p>
      The CRS data structure involves:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>M</b> and <b>N</b>, the number of rows and columns of the matrix
          (we'll often assume assume the matrix is square, in which case
          <b>M=N</b>);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>NZ_NUM</b>, the number of nonzero entries in the matrix.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>ROW(1:M+1)</b>, the location in <b>COL</b> and <b>A</b> of
          the first entry associated with each row; the last entry of
          <b>ROW</b> indicates where the first entry of row <b>M+1</b>
          would go.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>COL(1:NZ_NUM)</b>, the column indices of the nonzero entries;
          entries are grouped by row.  Within each row, the
          entries are presumed to be ascending sorted by column;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>A(1:NZ_NUM)</b>, the nonzero entries;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The associated CRS file format to store this information uses
      3 separate files, containing the column, row, and entry information
      separately.  The value of <b>N</b> can be inferred from the maximum
      value to occur in the column file.  The value of <b>M</b> can be inferred
      from the length of the row file (minus 1), and the value of
      <b>NZ_NUM</b> from the length of the column or entry files.

      CRS File Characteristics:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A matrix is described by three files.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each file is in the ASCII format;
        </li>
        <li>
          Each line contains a single value.
        </li>
        <li>
          depending on the programming language being used, the indices in
          the <b>ROW</b> and <b>COLUMN</b> arrays may be 0-based or
          1-based.
