    <p>
      <b>PGH_MRI</b> is a data directory which
      contains examples of files stored in a format for magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) data.  It was proposed as an intermediate format,
      much simpler than the standard DICOM format, but more extensible than
      formats such as that used by ANALYZE.
    </p>

    <p>
      A typical dataset comprises two files:
      <ul>
        <li>
          a <i>header file</i>, an ASCII formatted file, each line of
          which contains a keyword and value;
        </li>
        <li>
          a <i>data file</i>, a binary file containing ((X*Y)*Z)*T sets of
          values, representing Z slices, each an X by Y image, possibly
          repeated over T times.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
