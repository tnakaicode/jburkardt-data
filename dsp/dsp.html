      DSP <br> A Sparse Triplet Matrix File Format
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>DSP</b> is a data directory which
      contains examples of the DSP sparse matrix data structure and file format.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <b>DSP</b> format is used by CSPARSE ( "sparse triplet",
      except that there the indices are 0-based),
      by DLAP/SLAP (nonsymmetric SLAP triad format),
      by MATLAB, and by SPARSEKIT ("COO" or "coordinate" format).
    </p>

    <p>
      The <i>DSP data structure</i> simply records, for each nonzero
      entry of the matrix, the row, column and value.  Thus, the information
      in the data structure might be
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>M</b> and <b>N</b>, the number of rows and columns in the
          (original full) matrix;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>NZ_NUM</b>, the number of nonzero elements in the matrix;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>ROW(1:NZ_NUM)</b>, the row indices of the nonzero elements;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>COL(1:NZ_NUM)</b>, the column indices of the nonzero elements;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>VAL(1:NZ_NUM)</b>, the values of the nonzero elements;
        </li>
      </ul>
      Row and column indices are 1-based.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is possible that a pair of indices (I,J) may occur more than
      once.  Presumably, in this case, the intent is that the actual value
      of A(I,J) is the sum of all such entries.  This is not a good thing
      to do, but I seem to have come across this in MATLAB.
    </p>

    <p>
      The data structure does not require that the data be sorted.
      However, for efficient lookup and modification, it is very useful
      to be able to assume that the data is sorted.  One natural sorting
      would be by ROW first, and then by COLUMN.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another sorting convention might require that the first N entries
      of the data structure contain the information describing the diagonal
      entries of the matrix.  If this is done, then diagonal preconditioning
      is easy to carry out.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <i>DSP file format</i> is an ASCII file of
      <b>NZ_NUM</b> lines, with each line corresponding to a
      nonzero entry of the matrix, and containing the row index,
      column index and value of that entry, separated by spaces.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that MATLAB has the ability to read in a DSP file directly,
      via commands like:
      <pre><b>
        data = load ( 'mydata.dsp' );
        A = spconvert ( data );
      </b></pre>
    </p>

      Example:
    </h3>

    <p>
      The 4 by 6 matrix
      <pre>
        11   0   0  14   0  16
         0  22   0   0  25  26
         0   0  33  34   0  36
        41   0  43  44   0  46
      </pre>
      could be stored as a DSP file which reads:
      <pre>
       ROW  COL   VAL
       ---  ---  ----
        1    1   11.0
        1    4   14.0
        1    6   16.0
        2    3   22.0
        2    4   25.0
        2    6   26.0
        3    3   33.0
        3    4   34.0
        3    6   36.0
        4    1   41.0
        4    3   43.0
        4    4   44.0
        4    6   46.0
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the data for this matrix is SORTED in the natural way,
      that is, the ROW and COLUMN entries are lexically sorted.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we specify that the diagonal elements must be listed first,
      we might instead have the following:
      <pre>
       ROW  COL   VAL
       ---  ---  ----
        1    1   11.0
        2    2    0.0
        3    3   33.0
        4    4   44.0
        1    4   14.0
        1    6   16.0
        2    3   22.0
        2    4   25.0
        2    6   26.0
        3    4   34.0
        3    6   36.0
        4    1   41.0
        4    3   43.0
        4    6   46.0
      </pre>
      Note that we had to insert a dummy "0.0" value for A(2,2), so that the storage
      requirements increased slightly.
