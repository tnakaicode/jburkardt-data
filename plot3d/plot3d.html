    <p>
      <b>PLOT3D</b> is a data directory which
      contains examples of files associated with the PLOT3D program.
      PLOT3D is actually a plotting program used to display the results
      of various physical calculations.  There is no single file format.
      Instead, there are families of file types whose structure depends
      on the spatial dimension, time dependence, and dimensionality
      of the object being stored.

      PLOT3D File Characteristics:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          ASCII or binary
        </li>
        <li>
          1D, 2D, or 3D
        </li>
        <li>
          No compression
        </li>
        <li>
          Multiple auxilliary variables allowed
        </li>
        <li>
          3D data can be stored as a whole, or grouped into planes.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      PLOT3D files include X, XY and XYZ files, which contain
      coordinate information, an XYZB file, which contains 3D coordinates
      and blanking information which suppresses some locations,
      Q files which include the density scalar, momentum vector, and
      energy scalar at each coordinate location, and F files, which
      record a single scalar value at each coordinate.
