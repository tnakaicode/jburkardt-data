      HB Files <br> Harwell Boeing <br> Sparse Matrix File Format
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>HB</b> is a data directory which
      contains examples of files in the "HB" or "Harwell Boeing"
      Sparse Matrix File Format, used to store a sparse matrix in a file.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the Rutherford Boeing format is an updated, more flexible
      version of the Harwell Boeing format.
    </p>

    <p>
      The space required to
      represent the matrix is reduced by using a compressed column
      storage format.  If the matrix is read from the file into memory,
      it is common to use the same compressed column storage to
      represent the matrix in memory.
    </p>

    <p>
      A matrix is an <b>m</b> by <b>n</b> rectangular array of numbers.
      A <i>sparse</i> matrix is one in which "most" of the entries are zero.
      If the matrix is sparse enough, then it is often much more efficient
      not to allocate space for the full <b>m*n</b> set of entries, but
      rather to keep track of the location and value of the nonzero entries.

    <p>
      Each character of the <b>MXTYPE</b> variable specifies a separate
      fact about the matrix:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>R</b>, <b>C</b> or <b>P</b> indicates that the matrix
          values are <i>real</i>, <i>complex</i>, or that only the
          <i>pattern</i> of nonzeroes is going to be supplied.  Note
          that if complex arithmetic is specified, then any data vectors
          included in the file will also be assumed to be complex.
          FORTRAN I/O treats a complex number as a simple pair of real numbers.
          Thus, a line that records the single complex number <b>12+17i</b>
          would look like
          <pre>
            12.0  17.0
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>U</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>Z</b> or <b>R</b> indicates that
          the matrix is symmetric, unsymmetric, Hermitian, skew symmetric,
          or rectangular.  Each of these facts implies something about how
          the nonzero elements of the matrix are stored in the file.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>U</b>: if the matrix is unsymmetric (and square), then every nonzero
              element of the matrix corresponds to an entry in the file.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>S</b>: if the matrix is symmetric (which implies that it is square),
              (and which typically only occurs for
              real arithmetic), then half of the nonzero off-diagonal elements don't
              need to be stored in the file.  A user need only specify the
              diagonal elements, and perhaps just those beneath the diagonal.
              A program reading the file must, correspondingly, assume that
              a value associated with one off-diagonal element should also
              be assigned to its corresponding transposed location.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>H</b>: if the matrix is Hermitian, (which implies that it is square)
              (and which typically only occurs for
              complex arithmetic), then half of the nonzero off-diagonal elements don't
              need to be stored in the file.  A user need only specify the
              diagonal elements, and perhaps just those beneath the diagonal.
              A program reading the file must, correspondingly, assume that
              a value associated with one off-diagonal element should also
              be used to assign a value to its corresponding transposed location.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Z</b>: if the matrix is skew symmetric, (which implies that it is square)
              (and which typically only occurs for
              real arithmetic), then the diagonal is zero, and only half of the
              nonzero offdiagonal elements need to be stored.  (I believe
              that the <b>Z</b> code is only appropriate for a real matrix,
              and that the case of a skew Hermitian matrix is not provide for!)
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>R</b>: if the matrix is rectangular, then every nonzero element of the matrix
              must be stored.  In effect, this is the same as the unsymmetric case.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>A</b> indicates that the matrix is "assembled" (the typical case)
          while <b>E</b> indicates that the matrix is a finite element matrix
          that is going to be described as the "sum" of a set of smaller
          matrices.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      Each character of the <b>RHSTYP</b> specifies a separate fact about
      the right hand side information.  (Of course, if there are no right
      hand sides, (RHSCRD = 0) then there is no header line 5, and hence
      no need to worry about this variable!)
    </p>

    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>F</b> means that all vectors will be listed as "full" vectors,
          that is, as a list of <b>NROW</b> numbers; <b>M</b> means that,
          instead, all vectors will be listed in the same format as the matrix.
          The <b>M</b> option only makes sense if the matrix is being presented
          in unassembled format.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>G</b> means that one or more starting guesses or approximate
          solution vectors are being supplied.  If no guess vectors are
          supplied, this character should be blank (or, actually, anything
          but a <b>G</b>).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>X</b> means that one or more exact solution vectors are being
          supplied.  If no exact solution vectors are supplied, leave this
          character blank.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>
      The Data Records
    </h3>

    <p>
      After the header lines comes data.  This data is organized into four
      distinct sets, of pointers, indices, matrix values, and right hand side
      information.  The number of lines devoted to each set of information were
      specified in header line number 2.  It is common for the final set of data
      to be omitted.  In a few cases, the third set, which describes matrix
      values, is omitted.  In that case, the file only has information about
      <i>where</i> the nonzero entries of the matrix are, but does not actually
      specify what those values are.  Such a matrix file is called a "pattern"
      matrix, and in fact, if this is the case, usually the first character
      of <b>MXTYPE</b> is given as <b>P</b> for "pattern only".
